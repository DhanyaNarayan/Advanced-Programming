# Word Frequency Counter

## Overview
This Python script counts the frequency of each word in a given string and outputs the results in a dictionary format. The script is designed to process a text string, split it into individual words, and tally how many times each word appears.

## Code Explanation

### Functionality
The script performs the following steps:
1. **Splitting the String**: The input string is split into a list of words.
2. **Counting Frequencies**: The script counts the occurrences of each word in the list.
3. **Storing Results**: The word counts are stored in a dictionary where the keys are words and the values are their respective counts.
4. **Printing Results**: The dictionary is printed to display the word counts.
